# JolFinder_App

The applications aim was to help people find events or festivals near them. So basically like a party finder.
The main purpose of the research was the effect of Covid on the night industry. With this app I am helping people socialise again as well as helping the night sector with business.

This application was made as a university project and is still in very early stages of development.
I intend to work further on the application in my freetime as I am still focusing on my university studies.

This was a group project but I took it over as I did the actual application and they did the research. My group did not want to work on it further so I took it over.

The application uses MySQL as the database which is run through XAMPP

Below is some snippets of the application running:
